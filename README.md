<a name="Customization"></a>
## Customization

After you install a fresh copy of Nextpack, the only thing you need to do is customizing it to meet your needs, before start codig your package.


The steps include renaming the code samples shipped with the Nextpack:

1. Change the namespace of the application from `Nextpack\Nextpack` to your `Vendor-name\Package-name`. *(you can do this using the [Replace All] feature of your IDE).*
2. Update the following values in `composer.json`:  `name`, `description`, `keywords`, `authors`, `autoload` and don't forget to update the `namespaces`. (you might need to run `composer dump-autoload` after the changes).
3. Run `composer install`
4. Rename `SampleFacadeAccessor.php` and update the returned string inside the `getFacadeAccessor()` function.
5. Rename `NextpackServiceProvider` and update the content of the following functions: `facadeBindings()`, `configPublisher()` and `implementationBindings()`.
6. Update the config file `nextpack.php`, (or remove it if not necessary).
7. Delete this `README.md` file. And rename the `README.md.READY` to `README.md`.
8. Update `LICENSE` by replacing `::Vendor-Name` and `::Package-Name` with your vendor and package names.
9. Edit the new `README.md` 
13. Delete the sample `tests` function. Keep the `TestCase.php`.
14. Update the "testsuite" name in the `phpunit.xml`.
